Time Tracker
==================

Release: -

#### Project Description

This project will be an improvement on the time tracking interface currently in use at the company I work for. I built the previous version with pure Django when I was a more novice developer and it has a few limitations in it's design.

The next version will be implemented using React.js and Django REST Framework to provide a much cleaner interface. It will have the following features:

- User Registration
- "Team" invitation codes
- User management within a "Team"
- Projects for which hour reports can be tracked
- Simple hour recording (time in, time out, project, task, etc.)
- Reports (per project, team member, date window, etc.)
